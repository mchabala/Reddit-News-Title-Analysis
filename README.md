# Reddit-News-Title-Analysis

While 2020 was an extremely sedintary year of life for most, the year was characterized by unprecedented events such as global pandemic, racial equality movements, and accusations of election fraud. In an effort to identify the topics and issues the world was paying the most attention to throughout the year, I created racing bar charts to highlight the most frequently used words in r/news titles. The bar lengths in the first racing bar chart represent the simple cumulative sum of word frequencies in r/news titles throughout the year. The second racing bar chart is the same as the first, except that the frequency count is a running total. Only words from headlines that have been posted within the previous 75 days of the date shown in the bottom right corner are represented in the visual. This second approach gives more opportunity for more current topics to make an appearance in the chart.

I also created simple pie and bar charts highlighting the most frequently used words in the top 1000 r/news posts this year.

Github only displays static versions of Jupyter Notebooks. A video of the moving total racing bar chart can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkMVSotK8mk
